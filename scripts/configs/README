config06	config for run06
config08	...
config09	Config we used for most NILC SBI testing
config10	Same as 09 but with perturbed true values
config11	Similar to 09 but slighly broader priors, and slighly perturbed true values # USE FOR PAPER
config12	Same as 11 but including gamma_beta_dust
config13	more realistic gamma_beta_dust priors and true values
config14	like 13 but Alens=0.4 and higher lmax
config15	like 14 but with WMAP K and Planck 353.
config16	like 15 but with synchrotron.
config17	like 16 but restrict gamma_beta_sync and amp_beta_sync to avoid numerical issues in pyilc
config18	much more restrictive prior compared to 17
config19	same as 18 but with lmin = 10
config20	like config18 but without gamma for dust and sync
config21	like config18 but with very narrow prior for all but gamma parameters
config22	like config18 but prior on A_d_BB centered on 28 and wider dust amps.
config23	like config22 but without gamma for dust and sync
config24	like config22 but with very narrow prior for all but gamma parameters
config25	like config22 but with wider Ad, alpha_d, beta_d, A_s, alpha_s, beta_s priors
config26	like 25 but larger standard deviation for Ad.
config27	like 26 but with very narrow prior for r and A_lens
